# TODO


* [ ] create new inference notebooks
* [ ] update README with instructions for creating the stanmodel.pkl files before installing
* [ ] can we generate the mean and covariance of the STAN results, since the hyperparameters are not fixed?
* [ ] make sure thinning and sampling is done okay, including which sample we take for calculating things
